# Rock Paper Scissors
so this is a one player rock paper scissors game using flask, mediapipe, and svelte. I haven't seen many projects using mediapipe and svelte so I thought I could make a game using that. The backend is using flask for simplicity as it isn't many lines of code and I didn't want to overcomplicate this.
