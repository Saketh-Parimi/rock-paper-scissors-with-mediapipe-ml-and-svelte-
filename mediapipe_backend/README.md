# Backend
This is a simple backend which will get the landmark points from the frontend and the model will predict whether it's rock, paper, or scissors. Just

# Setup
first, do python/python3 -m venv venv (will create environment). Then do source /venv/bin/activate (taps into the environment) (this is on mac. idk what it is on windows or linux.) Then do pip install -r requirements.txt (will install required packages to environment). Then do python app.py (runs the backend)
